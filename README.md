Brushing up on skills. Creating a box model diagram using CSS and HTML.  I copied the TeamTreehouse box model diagram from "The CSS Box Model Concept" lesson.

Personally, I'm trying to learn to use GitHub, HTML and CSS.  So I thought I'd tackle creating a box model diagram using only markup and styling it with CSS.  It's obviously something extremely simple to make in Photoshop, but for a beginning coder, this seems like it might be good exercise.

UPDATE: Completed this task in little under 3 hours. (09/19/14)  

My next goal is to make this design responsive so it resizes properly for mobile displays.
