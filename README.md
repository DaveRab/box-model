=========

Brushing up on skills. Creating a box model diagram using CSS and HTML.  I copied the TeamTreehouse box model diagram from "The CSS Box Model Concept" lesson.

Personally, I'm trying to learn to use GitHub, HTML and CSS.  So I thought I'd tackle creating a box model diagram using only markup and styling it with CSS.  It's obviously something extremely simple to make in Photoshop, but for a beginning coder, this seems like it might be good exercise.

UPDATE: Completed this task in little under 3 hours. (09/19/14)  The obvious lesson is that this is definitely more viable to create in Photoshop and then use an img tag to place it.  But the exercise was great practice in positioning elements.


My next goal is to make this design responsive so it resizes properly for mobile displays.
