Brushing up on skills. Creating a box model diagram using CSS and HTML.

I'm personally trying to learn to use GitHub, HTML and CSS.  So I thought I'd tackle creating a box model diagram using only markup and styling it with CSS.  It's obviously something extremely simple to make in Photoshop, but for a beginning coder, this seems like it might be good exercise.
